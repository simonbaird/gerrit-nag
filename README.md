This project consists of two components, __[Gerrit Nag](#gerrit-nag)__ and
__[Nagbot](#nagbot)__.

# Gerrit Nag

A Python 3 script that queries Gerrit and shows a list of how many patch sets
are waiting on reviews by each team member. If slow code reviews are a
bottle-neck in your team, this list can help remind and encourage developers
to do their reviews.

The output is plain text which you can share via email or IRC.

# Nagbot

Nagbot is an IRC bot written in Python 2 using Twisted. It can respond to
requests to run Gerrit Nag on IRC and reply with the results.

Nagbot responds to the following commands:

````
nagbot: team report
nagbot: team average
nagbot: how many reviews for sbaird?
````

It can do a few other things and will generally try to be polite and answer
when spoken to.


## Example Usage

````
$ ./nagbot.py \
    --host irc.example.com \
    --port 6667 \
    --channel foodev \
    --users finn,jake,marcy,pb,lsp \
    --gerrit https://gerrit.example.com \
    --project foo
